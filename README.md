**Project Overview**

The Taxi Management System is designed to streamline the operations of a taxi service platform. It allows administrators to manage drivers, vehicles, and platform operations efficiently. This project consists of two main modules: Admin Module and Driver Module, each serving specific roles to ensure a smooth workflow. The system uses Java Servlets for backend processing and MySQL as the database to store information about drivers, vehicles, and system data.
